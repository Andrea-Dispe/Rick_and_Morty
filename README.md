This is an exercise I did to test myself to create an app with featues like search-bar and pagination without exetrnal libraries. 
It queries the external API and displays the content on clickable cards. Each card clicked opens a modal with information coming from the API.
Each card can be set to be a favourite and they will be visibile in its relative page.
The search bar and pagination filter the content accordingly.
